This is a blank/vanilla presentation with the template of the university of Bern.
It was whittled down from [my 2019 talk at the Bruker micro-CT Users Meeting](https://github.com/habi/20190605_BrukerUserMeeting).
This means that I removed all the non-necessary files from a copy of the repository with [this howto](https://blog.ostermiller.org/git-remove-from-history).
